/// The `error` module defines and manages errors that can occur within the application.
///
/// This module typically contains custom error types, error handling utilities,
/// and logic for propagating and formatting errors used throughout the application.
///
/// # Notes
/// - Ensure all error types implemented here provide useful context for debugging and tracing issues.
/// - Consider implementing traits like `std::fmt::Display`, `std::error::Error`, and `From` where applicable
///   for better interoperability.

/// The `uuid` module provides functionality for working with Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs).

/// This module may include operations such as generating new UUIDs, parsing UUIDs from strings,

/// implementations, which are not shown within this context.
